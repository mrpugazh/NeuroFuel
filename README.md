#  NeuroFuel – Smart Energy Distribution in AI Brain Cells

  A Java-based simulation that models intelligent energy management in AI systems using **Dynamic Programming (0/1 Knapsack)**. This project helps artificial brain cells (neurons) decide which tasks to activate when energy is limited — optimizing for **maximum total priority**.

---

## Project Overview

In AI systems, every task (neuron) consumes energy and has a priority based on importance. With limited energy (like in self-driving cars or drones), it’s not possible to activate all neurons. **NeuroFuel** solves this using a **0/1 Knapsack Dynamic Programming algorithm** that selects the best combination of neurons to activate while staying within an energy budget.
